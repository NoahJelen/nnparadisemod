I have used code from these mods in my mod while creating it:
Quark by Vazkii (I used this code as examples for mine)
Portable Craft Bench mod by RenEvo
The vanilla minecraft code (to see how it's done)

I have also used snippets of code from the forge forums in my mod.
almost all of my textures are based off of the vanilla textures and all of them have been made with GIMP.
All of my block and item models use vanilla models or use custom models created by Blockbench.
